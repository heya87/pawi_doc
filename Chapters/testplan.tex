\section{Introduction}


\subsection{Test concept}

The project was tested on two levels. The first level is Unit Testing in Java. This tests are not documented in the report itself. Since the project was developed in a continuous integration environment, all unit tests were run after committing any changes to the git repository. If any test did not pass, the build would fail. With this functionality, the most important and critical functions of the functionalities are already covered. The continuous integration environment is described in the system requirement specification (\ref{Software Requirement Specification}). \linebreak 
However the second level are test cases which are defined against the software requirement specification and are performed as blackbox test.  To do so, test cases were defined so they cover all the features defined in the software requirement specification. 

\subsection{Test cases}

This section contains all test cases which cover the features described in the software requirement specification. The results of the single test runs can be found in the test protocol (\ref{Test protocol}).

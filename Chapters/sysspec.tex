\section{Introduction}



\subsection{Purpose}

The software requirement specification should provide all needed information to develop the context extraction framework and define all delivery objects. All interfaces to external components, input and output data, deployment considerations and quality attribute should be well defined within this document.


\subsection{Scope}


The context extraction framework will perform automated text extraction on a set of HTML test data with two to three different text extraction algorithms. The performance of each algorithm is measured and an output file with the measured results is generated.

\section{System Features}

In this chapter, each system feature is specified. 


	\begin{tabular}{ | p{3cm} | p{12cm} |}
	\hline
	\textbf{Name} 				& Read configuration 				\\ \hline
	\textbf{Feature id} 		& f1 				\\ \hline
	\textbf{Description} 		& The text extraction framework is configurable with an external text file. The configuration file will contain following items:
								 \begin{itemize}
							        \item Path to folder with html files
							        \item Path to folder with text files
							        \item Path to folder with output files
							        \item Configuration for algorithms
							        \item etc.
						        \end{itemize}

						        The configuration file location is defined as a relative path to the source directory. The configuration file is structured in a key value list:

	\hline
	\textbf{Name} 				& Create test \\ \hline
	\textbf{Feature id} 		& f2 \\ \hline
	\textbf{Description} 		& A test contains two input files which are a html file and a text file. They are located in the defined directories by the configuration. As soon as the test framework finds a html and a text file with the same name, a new test is created and the files are read.\\ \hline

	\hline
	\textbf{Name} 				& Run test \\ \hline
	\textbf{Feature id} 		& f3 \\ \hline
	\textbf{Description} 		& A test is run as defined in the configuration file. The configuration file defines which algorithms are tested. The output of a test is a text file which contains the results. 								A result file is formatted as follows: * \\ \hline

\section{Planning concept}

So as to plan the project, the planning frameworks scrum was used.\\
For a first rough planning, the assignment is split into working packages and assigned to milestones. Delivery objects are defined for each milestone.\\
This plan is then assigned to the given time table of about 12 weeks. The project effort is defined as 180 hours. This results in about 15 hours work load per week.

As working with Scrum, each milestone was defined as a sprint. At each start of a sprint, the working packages were adjusted if needed and were then spitted into stories. In the following section all the milestones are listed with its working packages and stories. The working packages were defined at the very beginning of the project and the stories were defined at the start of each milestone/sprint. To see the adjustments made during the project, the definition of the working packages was not adapted for this final documentation.

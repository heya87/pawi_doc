\section{Planning concept}

So as to plan the project, a combination of the two well known planning frameworks scrum and RUP are used.\\
For a first rough planning, the assignment is split into working packages and assigned to milestones. Delivery objects are defined for each milestone.\\
This plan is then assigned to the given time table of about 12 weeks. The project effort is defined as 180 hours. This results in about 15 hours work load per week.

A more detailed planning is done for the incoming milestone / sprint. The predefined working packages are split into smaller packages. For the first draft, only the first milestone is split into smaller packages. The later milestones are going to be defined in more detail as soon as all needed information is available. 

The effort needed for the documentation is not listed separately. All the tasks already contain additional time for updating the documentation.

The milestones dates are not finally defined, which means that the meeting dates can vary by up to some days. sadfjsal√∂dkfjsadlk

    \textbf{Id} & s0\\ \hline
    \textbf{Estimated time} & 4h \\ \hline
    \textbf{Description} &  As a project owner, you need to have a time schedule so that you can see when you will achieve which results. The PAWI project is split into several working packages which are then split into single stories. The working packages are assignment to milestones and for each milestone, delivery objects are defined. This can be a document, a piece of test or production code or some other kind of work.\\

\section {Conclusion}

With the test framework it is now possible to compare text extraction algorithms against each other and get a general information about the performance. We can now rate the performance of the two algorithms JusText and Boilerpipe and with the implemented software architecture it is easy to integrate and test additional algorithms as well. We can not only compare algorithms with each other but as well investigate the single algorithms and their output more closely for specific test cases. This helps to find problems and strengths of existing algorithms and may help to improve them or implement our own algorithm. Based on the results, we can say that JusText performs better context extraction than Boilerpipe.
The missing requirement is the implementation of a new algorithm but with dropping this requirement it was possible to implement the additional functions for investigating the existing algorithms more closely, which will help to improve the existing ones as well as developing a possible new approach in the future.

\section{Lessons learned}

\subsection{Planning}

We did underestimate the effort needed for the documentation. Especially putting together all the single documents and writing the main part took more time then we expected. There are a lot of little things which we did not took in consideration during the planning phase but which need to be done at some point.

\subsection{Programming}
\begin{itemize}
\item It is very important to test software early and often. Most of the critical components were tested right from the beginning. However, if not, a time loss was almost expected for sure because bugs sneaked into the code and needed to be taken care of.

\item I used the programming language Python the first time for this project. Even, only small adjustments on the JusText project needed to be done, a basic knowledge about Python is now present as well as a solution, how to interact with Python from a Java application.

\item I had very basic knowledge about text processing and text extraction. Working with the topic for this project extended my knowledge quite a bit.


\end{itemize}

\section{Further work}

With the test framework we have now the tool to examine text extraction algorithms very close. The next steps will be an exact evaluation of the weaknesses from the algorithms so we can improve them or we can implement our own approach, which handles these problems better. The test framework can then be used at any point during the development phase to check the performance of the algorithm very easy and compare it with the existing ones.
